## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome, the project uses the [standard](http://standardjs.com) code style. This is just one giant hack so there are no tests, have fun and try not to break stuff, a tough ask without tests!

For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/mattstyles/the-grappler/issues).
